    "## A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of that data. There are two main types of databases: SQL (relational) databases and NoSQL (non-relational) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model of data, which organizes data into tables that have relationships with one another. SQL databases use SQL as their primary language for querying and managing data. SQL databases are known for their reliability, consistency, and ease of use. They typically have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data and the relationships between tables. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases do not use tables with fixed relationships, but rather use flexible data models such as document, key-value, or graph databases. NoSQL databases typically use their own query languages or APIs for querying and managing data. NoSQL databases are known for their scalability, flexibility, and high performance. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
